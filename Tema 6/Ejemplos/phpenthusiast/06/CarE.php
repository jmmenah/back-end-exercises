//  we create a hello() method in the parent class that returns the string "beep" and override it
//  in the child class with a method by the same name that returns a different string, "Halllo".

// The parent class has hello method that returns "beep".
class CarE {
    public function hello()
    {
        return "beep";
    }
}

//The child class has hello method that returns "Halllo"
class SportsCar extends CarE {
    public function hello()
    {
        return "Hallo";
    }
}

//Create a new object
$sportsCar1 = new SportsCar();

//Get the result of the hello method
echo $sportsCar1 -> hello();
